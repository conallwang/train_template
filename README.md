## Training Template

A template to perform the PyTorch training, maybe saving some time. 

## TODO

- [ ] Implement Multi-GPU version. The current version only support single GPU training. For multiple GPUs, refer to [NPVA/train.py](https://github.com/conallwang/NPVA/blob/main/train.py).

## Usage

1. The training program begins from [train.py](./train.py).

2. You just follow the running stream and fill each 'TODO' thing.
